# memory-leaks

The objective of this program is to detect memory leaks in Linux, similar to the `leaks` program in Mac OS X.

This is a brief summary of the `leaks` program in Mac OS X:

         ( https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/leaks.1.html )

     SYNOPSIS
          leaks pid | partial-executable-name [-nocontext] [-nostacks] [-exclude symbol] [-trace address]

     DESCRIPTION
          leaks identifies leaked memory -- memory that the application has allocated, but has been lost and can-not cannot
          not be freed.  Specifically, leaks examines a specified process's memory for values that may be point-ers pointers
          ers to malloc-allocated buffers. [...]

          For each leaked buffer that is found, leaks prints the address of the leaked memory and its size.[...]

This OS X's `leaks` program relies on OS X's Libc library, which is not the same that in Linux 
( http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/Libc/ ), ie., not is not the GNU Libc nor a replacement
like ucLibc.

GNU Libc does provide a mtrace() library call to debug the memory allocations 
( http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Allocation-Debugging.html ) but it requires 
the calling mtrace() inside the source code (before compilation). There is a Perl script able
to parse the debug file generated by the mtrace sub-system 
( https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=malloc/mtrace.pl#l147 )

Valgrind is an excellent system to debug memory leaks, among many other possibilities as memory corruption, but it is not 
easy to use it in a Production environment because of the performance penalty.
